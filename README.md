# Learning Resources
A repository for learning resources and notes on DevOps tools and concepts, including Docker commands, CI/CD configurations, and Kubernetes basics. This repository serves as a personal knowledge base to document my learning journey in the field of DevOps.

## Purpose and Use
I created this repository to consolidate my learning resources and notes on various DevOps tools and practices. As a fresher in the field, I recognize the importance of hands-on experience and structured knowledge when it comes to mastering complex concepts.

### Why This Repository?
- **Structured Learning**: This repository helps me organize my notes and resources in a structured manner, making it easier to review and reference as I progress in my learning journey.
- **Documentation of Knowledge**: By documenting what I've learned, I can track my growth and revisit concepts as needed.
- **Contribution and Collaboration**: I aim to encourage collaboration and contributions from others who are also learning or have expertise in these areas. Sharing knowledge can lead to better understanding and new insights.

### Learning Journey
As I dive deeper into DevOps, I am focusing on practical applications of tools such as **Docker** for containerization, **CI/CD** practices for automating software delivery, and **Kubernetes** for orchestrating containerized applications. This repository not only reflects my learning but also serves as a resource for others who may be on a similar path.
